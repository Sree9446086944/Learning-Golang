   You probably have more than one go module in your workspace. If that is the case, you can change the go extension settings, in order to allow gopls to look for multiple modules in the workspace. Just add the following to your settings.json:

To solve this, follow below steps :

step 1 : Open Vscode, and then go to settings.

step 2 : In the search bar , type gopls

step 3 : Just below that you will find settings.json, click on that

step 4 : Paste the below code their "gopls": { "experimentalWorkspaceModule": true, }

step 5 : Save it and restart the Vscode, You are good to go now.
