- memory allocation and deallocation happens automatically
- we create and allocate based on 2 methods for memory management;
  these methods allocate memory and we can put datastructures - array,slices, var etc
   - new()
      - allocate memory but no INIT
      - you will get memory address nd can reference using pointers
      - zeroed storage, i.e, cannot put any data initially

    - make()
      - Allocate memory and INIT, so use that memory and put value in it
      - you will get memory address and can reference using pointers
      - non zeroed storage, i.e, can put data initially

- Garbage collection(GC) happens automatically
- anything Out of scope or var which becomes nill are eligible for GC based on certain threshold/condition of GC
- https://pkg.go.dev/runtime
- there is functions available to get resources or change values
